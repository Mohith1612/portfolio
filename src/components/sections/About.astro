        My work is an ongoing effort to design and build backend systems that
        are clear, resilient, and dependable in real-world use. I take
        responsibility for how software behaves in production and aim to create
        systems that respect both operational limits and the people who rely on
        them.
      </p>
      <p>
        I specialize in backend architecture, where I design and maintain
        services and infrastructure that support complex behavior while
        remaining predictable, observable, and easy to reason about. My process
        is deliberately reductive: I remove unnecessary layers until the
        system's core responsibilities are explicit and well-defined.
      </p>
      <p>
        Currently, I focus on end-to-end backend development, static-first and
        API-driven architectures, and the practical application of DevOps
        practices to deliver reliable, scalable systems in production.
